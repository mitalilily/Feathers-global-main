    <Typography>
      Access to the Feather Global Shopify app is free. There is no app subscription, paid feature,
      installation fee, or app usage fee. Feather Global does not charge buyers and does not act as a
      Shopify payment gateway.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Merchants may optionally purchase courier labels and postage through Feather Global. Money added
      to the Feather Global wallet can be used only for courier, postage, and directly related shipping
      charges. These operational shipping purchases do not unlock app access or features.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Merchants authorize Feather Global to read selected orders and update order or fulfillment status
      only for shipping workflows they initiate. Merchants remain responsible for the accuracy of
      shipment details, lawful goods, packaging, customs/tax duties, and compliance with courier
      restrictions.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      Feather Global never collects or refunds a buyer's Shopify order payment. Shopify order-payment
      refunds must be issued through Shopify and the original payment processor. Courier-service
      charge reversals are returned only to the same merchant Feather Global wallet that paid the charge.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>

const FreeAppRefundPolicy = () => (
  <PolicyShell title="Feather Global Shopify App Refund and Cancellation Policy">
    <Typography>
      The Shopify app is free, so there are no app subscription or app-feature charges to cancel
      or refund.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      A merchant can stop using the app and uninstall it from Shopify admin at any time. Uninstall
      revokes the connection and starts the Shopify privacy-deletion workflow.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      When an eligible courier booking is cancelled or a courier weight dispute is approved,
      Feather Global reverses only the corresponding courier-service debit to the same merchant Feather Global
      wallet. Feather Global does not credit, replace, or refund the value of a buyer's Shopify order.
      Buyer order refunds remain the merchant's responsibility in Shopify and must use the original
      payment processor or Shopify's supported store-credit flow.
